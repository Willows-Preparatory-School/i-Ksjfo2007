        //codespaces still require you to commit and push code
        //basically just an online VM to store my code and editor instead of having to download a java compiler each time
        //will opening this file again in a new codespace change anything? Will i be able to still use the basic java extensions i have downloaded, or will i have to re-set my settings each time?
        //I have opened the same file in a new codespace... it doesnt seem to save my VScode settings through different codespaces, but it does save codespaces so i can acess them at anytime... i do believe i need internet to make changes, or even acess the codespace.
        /*codespaces are a good way to edit and work on code with multiple people at once (or if i just want to keep everything in GitHub) but otherwise it makes more sense to use my local VScode application because it allows me to work on things without internet acess.
        but on the other hand, codespaces does not take up storage spaces... it still makes sense to clone each repository locally before the end of the week so i still have acess to my HW's in the future if i need them. I might use a mixture of codespaces and 
        cloning my repository locally for HWs and assignments though... it makes more logical sense. */
